        ## Implementation Hints
        - Check the relevant API endpoints in `/src/backend/routers/`
        - Look at frontend JavaScript in `/src/static/app.js` for UI issues
        - Verify database operations in `/src/backend/database.py`
        - Test both teacher authentication and student registration flows
