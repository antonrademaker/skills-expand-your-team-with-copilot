        ## Implementation Hints
        - Teacher accounts are stored in `/src/backend/database.py` in the `initial_teachers` list
        - Password hashing is handled in `/src/backend/routers/auth.py`
        - Login functionality is in `/src/static/app.js` (frontend) and `/src/backend/routers/auth.py` (backend)
        - Teacher authentication is required for student registration/unregistration endpoints
        - Consider updating the `teachers_collection` initialization if adding new teachers
        - Ensure password is properly hashed using the existing `hash_password` function
        - Test the complete login flow after making changes
