        ## Implementation Hints
        - Consider which parts of the system would need to be modified
        - Think about database changes that might be needed in `/src/backend/database.py`
        - Consider new API endpoints that might be required in `/src/backend/routers/`
        - Think about frontend changes needed in `/src/static/` files
        - Consider external dependencies or services that might be needed
        - Plan for testing the improvement thoroughly
        - Consider impact on system performance and user experience
