        ## Implementation Hints
        - UI styles are in `/src/static/style.css` (if it exists) or inline styles
        - HTML structure is in `/src/static/index.html`
        - JavaScript interactions are in `/src/static/app.js`
        - Consider using CSS flexbox or grid for better layouts
        - Test on different screen sizes for responsiveness
        - Use semantic HTML elements for better accessibility
        - Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability
        - Consider loading states and error handling in the UI
