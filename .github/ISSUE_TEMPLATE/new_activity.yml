        ## Implementation Hints
        - Add the new activity to `initial_activities` dictionary in `/src/backend/database.py`
        - Ensure the schedule format matches existing activities (days array, start_time, end_time in HH:MM format)
        - The activity should automatically appear in the UI without additional frontend changes
        - Test that the time filtering works correctly for the new activity
        - Verify that registration and unregistration work properly
