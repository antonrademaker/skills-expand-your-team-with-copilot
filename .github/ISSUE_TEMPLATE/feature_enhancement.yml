        ## Implementation Hints
        - Consider if this requires new API endpoints in `/src/backend/routers/`
        - Check if UI changes are needed in `/src/static/` files
        - Think about database schema changes in `/src/backend/database.py`
        - Consider authentication requirements for teacher-only features
        - Plan for responsive design if adding new UI elements
        - Consider adding new filters or sorting options if relevant
